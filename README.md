# Mathematical Analysis on Python
## Included are:
* Bisection method
* Euler method
* Neville method
* Newton's methon (Divided differences)
* Fixed point iteration
* Secant method
* Simpson algorithm
* Steffensen algorithm
* Superior order Taylor algorithm

\* **Disclaimer:** 
some bits and pieces of code are not perfect and are rather awkward. Spanish is also used with wild abandon, you'll just have to make do.
